## OPEN THE TERMINAL, GIT BASH OR POWERSHELL

## LOG INTO THE HPC
- SSH into the HPC:
  ```bash
  ssh your-psc-username@bridges2.psc.edu
  ```
- When prompted, type your password. You will not see any characters appear on the screen as you type (not even * symbols), but your input is still being recorded. Press Enter when done.

## GO TO PERSONAL STORAGE DIRECTORY
- Navigate to your personal storage directory:
  ```bash
  cd /ocean/projects/agr250001p/your-psc-username
  ```

## MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE SUBJECT FILE -- THE HUMAN GENOME
- List your directory contents (`ls`). You should have `GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna.gz` if you followed the instructions in class. Some of you should also have the partial `SRR741411_2.fastq.gz`
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna.gz
  SRR741411_2.fastq.gz
  ```
- **(OPTIONAL)** If you do not have the human genome file in your directory, download it using `wget`:
  ```bash
  wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/405/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna.gz
  ```
- List the directory again to confirm the download:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna.gz
  ```
- Decompress the file:
  ```bash
  gunzip GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna.gz
  ```
- List the directory to confirm you now have the uncompressed file:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna
  ```

## MOVE THE QUERY FILE FROM THE SHARED DIRECTORY TO YOUR PERSONAL STORAGE FOLDER
- Copy the unknown query DNA file to your directory. You were assigned one of five unknown files labeled `unk1 - unk5`:
  ```bash
  cp ../shared/week-3-data/human-genome/your-unk-file.fasta .
  ```
- List your directory contents to confirm the file was copied successfully:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna unk.fasta
  ```

## IT IS TIME TO BLAST
### Build a BLAST Database
- Load the BLAST software:
  ```bash
  module load BLAST
  ```
- Use the decompressed human genome file to create a local database:
  ```bash
  makeblastdb -in GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna -dbtype nucl -out human_genome_db
  ```
- Confirm that the database files were created:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna unk.fasta
  human_genome_db.nhr human_genome_db.nin human_genome_db.ndb
  human_genome_db.not human_genome_db.nsq human_genome_db.ntf human_genome_db.nto
  ```

### Run the BLAST Search
- Execute the BLAST search using the query sequence and the human genome database:
  ```bash
  blastn -query unk.fasta -db human_genome_db -out results.txt -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore stitle"
  ```
  - This command:
    - Takes the query file (`unk.fasta`) â€“ replace this with your assigned unknown file name.
    - Creates a file called `results.txt` containing the BLAST results.
    - Uses output format #6, which provides a tab-separated table with the following headers:
      ```
      qseqid  sseqid  pident  length  mismatch  gapopen  qstart  qend  sstart  send  evalue  bitscore  stitle
      ```

- Confirm that the results were generated:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna unk.fasta results.txt
  human_genome_db.nhr human_genome_db.nin human_genome_db.ndb
  human_genome_db.not human_genome_db.nsq human_genome_db.ntf human_genome_db.nto
  ```

- View the results:
  ```bash
  cat results.txt
  ```
  - The output will be a tab-separated table. Recall the output headers we specified above:
    ```
    qseqid  sseqid  pident  length  mismatch  gapopen  qstart  qend  sstart  send  evalue  bitscore  stitle
    ```
  - `qseqid` is the query sequence identifier (your unknown sequence).
  - `sseqid` is the matched sequence identifier from the database.
  - `pident` is the percentage of identical matches.
  - `mismatch` shows the number of base differences.
  - `evalue` indicates the statistical significance of the match (lower is better).

- Your output will likely contain **multiple hits** because you are blasting against the entire genome. If your query is a coding sequence, **each exon will likely have a hit**.

- **Use the first hit** to fill in the BLAST Analysis Handout.
